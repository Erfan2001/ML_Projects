# Machine Learning Projects

## Description:

Throughout my journey of studying machine learning algorithms, I actively engaged with my instructor to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. To facilitate easy access and organization, I meticulously categorized all relevant notebooks and files into specific branches within my repository, ensuring a structured and efficient learning process.

1) Regression
2) Classification
3) Recommender System

*Each project is in its own branch*
