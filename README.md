**About Dataset**

*Context*

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis about sentiment analysis, and I am planning to use Amazon customer reviews on cell phones.
There are other existing datasets on Amazon mobile/cell phones, but this dataset focuses on both unlocked and locked carriers,
and scoped on ten brands: ASUS, Apple, Google, HUAWEI, Motorola, Nokia, OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi.

*Content*

Published here are two files, items.csv and reviews.csv with a date prefixed which indicates when the data is retrieved.

items.csv contains retrieved (read: scraped) items from Amazon.com search results using generated URL and specific query string to search only specific brands and has minimal 1 star review.

reviews.csv contains reviews for previously retrieved items at items.csv but not with columns from items.csv.
